\begin{abstract}
	This paper seeks to investigate and propose solutions to win-rate disparities that arise in social deduction games with many powerful roles. We look at the roles that can be introduced to the smaller, informed team in order for them to resist the increased power and capabilities of the larger, uninformed team.\\
	We propose a formal combination of dynamic epistemic logic and epistemic inquiry, to form a dynamic epistemic inquiry language. We use this language to model the knowledge that our agents use as a foundation for their actions.\\
	To investigate this, we created our own social
	deduction game simulation based on the online game
	'Town of Salem'\cite{TownOfSalem}.\\
	Our experiments conclude that, for the smaller, informed team, obtaining more information and consistently removing players from the larger team, proved to be the most beneficial strategy.
