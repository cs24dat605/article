\section{Semantics}
The semantics of our language closely resemble the proposed in \cite{delimi},
our model however constitutes a need for additional mechanics, such as the
option for an agent to lie, and as a consequence of this, also the knowledge
and belief of another agents' ability to lie. while $DEL_{IMI}$ provides a
solid foundation for information gathering in a multiagent system, it is not
designed for a competitive one. That is, agents are by definition assumed to
answer truthfully.
