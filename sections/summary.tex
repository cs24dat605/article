This paper investigates the disparity between win-rates of opposing teams in 
social deduction games with an abundance of special roles. To do  this, an 
approach based on epistemic logic and common sense is used to create a 
simulation that emulates physical games of this type. The foundation of the 
game is based on other approaches within the same field, combining the ability 
of agents to inquire other agents for information, as well as giving them the 
ability to, naively, keep track of truths and lies. \\
The field of epistemology lays the groundwork of inference in the simulation, 
as well as providing a formal framework for the description of behaviour 
reliant on logical formulae within the simulation. \\
The simulation was built with a truth-table approach, resulting in a heavy 
computational burden, but with the benefit of being easy to understand 
intuitively. \\
The simulation was run with a multitude of different team compositions, which 
resulted in the revelation that the most important factor to consider when 
aiming for the creation of balanced social deduction games is the ratio of 
mafia members to town members. Secondly, it was found that killing-heavy mafia 
teams perform better than any other compositions. Lastly, excluding such teams 
showed 
that teams with the ability to acquire new information quickly performed better 
than those who could stop the town from performing their nightly actions.
