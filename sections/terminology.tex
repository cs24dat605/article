\section{Dynamic Inquiry Language} \label{sec:DynamicInquiryLanguage}
Based on the previous sections, we will now formalise a language, which purpose
is to model the agent's worlds. This includes communicating, inferring, and
updating their views based on newly acquired information.

The terminology and its notation used throughout this article will closely
align with Yacien Hamami \cite{delimi}, although not all aspects will be
presented here. Hamami uses an awareness operator to distinguish between
explicit and implicit knowledge and an oracle to avoid logical omniscience, we
however disregard this, as it is not within the scope of this article.

The motivation for this section is to formally define our modelling
prerequisites, and to argue for the correctness of these. First we define a
simple inquiry language, then extend this to our static inquiry language by
introducing agents and knowledge, finally culminating in defining our dynamic
inquiry epistemic language with information and model updates. An overview of
notations is provided in \cref{notationalschema}, for easy references. \\

Firstly, we will define our \textit{inquiry language}. Recall that in DELs,
factual information is represented in the propositional language and is
therefore also the inquiry language, denoted by \oracle, defined in BNF format:
\begin{align}
    \gamma::= p \sep\:\neg\gamma\sep(\gamma\land\gamma) \label{eq:1}
\end{align}
where \textbf{P} is a countable set of atomic propositions, $p \in\mathbf{P}$
and $\gamma$ reads as a proposition is either a fact, the negation of a
proposition or the conjunction of propositions. The \textit{inquiry language}
$\oracle$ is simply the symbol representing factual information based on
Hamami\cite{delimi}. It should be perceived as being the source of common
knowledge between agents, and therefore also does not have any notion of which
agents know what, or any distinguish-ability between worlds.

We can now extend the previous definitions to describe the \textit{static IMI
    epistemic language} \staticlang\: as follows:
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        \varphi ::= p \sep\neg\varphi\sep(\varphi \land \varphi) \sep (\varphi \lor \varphi) \sep (\varphi \rightarrow \varphi) \sep \\K_a\varphi \sep R_a((\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n), \varphi_i) \\ \text{where p} \in \text{\textbf{P}}\text{, a} \in \text{\textbf{Ag}}, n \in \mathbb{N}, i \in 1..n \label{eq:2}
    \end{split}
\end{align}
where \textbf{Ag} is a set of agents, the \textbf{knowledge operator} $K_a\varphi$ reads "agent \textit{a} implicitly knows that $\varphi$". We denote this as implicit knowledge, because by \cref{eq:1} an agent can imply knowledge from "$\rightarrow$", the \textbf{implies operator}. $R_a((\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n,), \varphi_i)$ reads as "$\varphi_i$ is the answer agent \textit{a} will provide to question $\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n$". \\

We can now define the \textit{IMI epistemic model}, a tuple:
\begin{align}
    M = \langle W, \sim_{a\in Ag}, V, R_{a\in Ag}\rangle \label{eq:3}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{-0.4em}
    \item W is non empty set of worlds.
    \item $\sim_{a\in Ag} \subseteq W \times W$ is a binary equivalence relation representing the indistinguishability relation of agent $a$, meaning that the relation is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.
    \item $V : W \rightarrow \mathscr{P}(\mathbf{P})$ is the atomic valuation function, which yields the propositions which are true in each world.
    \item $R_a : W \rightarrow \powset(\staticlang) \times \staticlang$ is the answering \newline rule of agent \textit{a} associating each world $w \in W$ with a pair of the form \aset $\:$ where $(\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n) \subseteq \staticlang$ and $\varphi_i \in \staticlang$.
\end{itemize}
Where $\mathscr{P}$ denotes the power-set. We introduce the answer operator, so agents are able to model or predict in possible worlds, based on what they know, what another agent will answer. They are modelled as pairs of a series of questions to one answer, because the provided answer to a series of questions can be a conjunction of propositions. We hypothesize that answering correctly according to a world, should imply some sense of truthfulness to this world. By our static epistemic language \staticlang\: and model $M$, we can define the following semantics:

\begin{gather}
    M, w |= p \iff p \in V(w) \label{sem:1}\\
    M, w |= \neg\varphi \iff M, w \not\models \varphi \label{sem:2}\\
    M, w |= (\varphi \land \psi) \iff M, w |= \varphi \land M, w |= \psi \label{sem:3}\\
    M, w |= (\varphi \lor \psi) \iff M, w |= \varphi \lor M, w |= \psi\label{sem:or}
    \\
    M, w |= \nonumber (\varphi \rightarrow \psi) \iff\\ M, w |= \varphi \implies M, w |= \psi \: or \: M, w \not\models \varphi \land M, w \not\models \psi\label{sem:implies}\\
    M, w |= \know \iff \forall u\in W, u \sim_{a} w \implies M, u |= \varphi \label{sem:4} \\
    M, w |= R_a \iff \aset \in R_a(w) \label{sem:5}
\end{gather}
While \cref{sem:1,sem:2,sem:3,sem:or,sem:implies} are trivial, \cref{sem:4} explains that the knowledge of some proposition \proposition is satisfied in world $w \in W$ if and only if it is also satisfied in all epistemically equivalent worlds by the indistinguishability relation $\sim_a$ for agent \textit{a}. That is, the agent does not distinguish between worlds, which by the knowledge in this does not have conflicting propositions. The answer function \cref{sem:5} is likewise only satisfied in a world given a model, when some pair of questions and answer is in the set of the agent answering operator.

\subsubsection*{Information Update}
To extend our static language \staticlang\: to a dynamic language, which we will donate as \dynlang, we introduce three new operators, the \textit{public information update operator}, the \textit{agent question operator} and the \textit{inference operator}:

\begin{equation}
    \pubop \sep \agquestop \sep \infop \label{eq:6}
\end{equation}
The public information update operator \pubop \: reads as "after public announcement of $\psi$, then \proposition is the case", with $\varphi, \psi \in \dynlang$. Formulas of the form \agquestop\: are read as "\proposition is the case after agent \textit{a} has asked the question $(\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n)$ to agent \textit{b}", and \infop\: is read as "\proposition is the case after agent \textit{a} has logically inferred $\psi_c$ from premises $\{\psi_1,...,\psi_m\}$". All these require some notion of model update, which we will define by a given model similar to \cref{eq:3}, and a model $M'$ as:
\begin{flalign}
    M|\varphi & = M' \label{eq:4}                                                   \\
    M'        & = \langle W', \sim'_{a\in Ag}, V', R'_{a\in Ag}\rangle \label{eq:5}
\end{flalign}
\\
In which $\proposition \in \dynlang$. Note that the expression $M|\varphi$ in \cref{eq:4} refers to a model update. This should be understood as $M'$ is the model in which all worlds where $\varphi$ is false or are not contained, are removed. The members of $M'$ is then given by:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $W' := \left\{ w' \in W \land M, w' \models \proposition \right\}$
    \item $\sim'_a := \sim_a \cap \:(W' \times W')$, for all $a \in Ag$
    \item $V' := V | W'$
    \item $R'_{a\in Ag} := R_{a\in Ag} | W'$
\end{itemize}
While all three operators are inherently information updates and follow the above listed transformations, the \textit{agent question operator}, which we will denote as $Q_{A}?$ with $Q_A = (\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n)$ and the \textit{inference operator} denoted by $I$, where $I = \{\psi_1,...,\psi_m \}\hookrightarrow \psi_c$, have additional constraints. An agent should not be able to ask a question without knowledge of it's presupposition, and it should be a part of the opposing agent's answer set. This can be described as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When $Q_A = (\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n) \in \powset(\staticlang)$, then if there
          exists $\varphi \in Q_A$ such that $M, w \models K_b\varphi$ and $(Q_A,
              \varphi_i) \in R_b (w)$, with $a, b \in Ag$ and, then:
          \begin{align}
              M^{a,b}_{Q_A}?(w) := M |\varphi_i
          \end{align}
    \item Otherwise, $M^{a,b}_{Q_{A}}?(w) := M$
\end{itemize}
Such that the updated model satisfy the worlds in which \proposition\: is also satisfied. Informally this can described as the updated model $M|\varphi_i$ contains the worlds in which the answer to $Q_A$ is also the expected answer, based on the answering rule \cref{sem:5}. Note that the semantic description does not specify how an agent should choose an answer. This we leave for the implementation in \cref{sec:implementation}. Additionally, we constrain the operator, such that agent $a$ asking question $Q_A$ should have knowledge about at least one of the propositions. This is necessary since questions are regarded as potentially a series of questions, and during an interrogation an agent can infer from intermediate answers. We formally describe the precondition to $Q_A?$ in \dynlang, where $Q_A = (\varphi_1,...,\varphi_n)$:

\begin{gather}
    pre_{a,b}(Q_A) := K_a\Biggl(\bigvee\limits_{i\in 1,n}\varphi_i\Biggr)
\end{gather}
The inference operator $I$ as we described earlier, can simply be denoted as a model update containing the conclusion based on the premises ${\psi_1,...,\psi_m} \hookrightarrow \psi_c$. We formally describe this as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $M$ be a DEL\textsubscript{IMI} model, $\psi_1,...,\psi_m, \psi_c \in
              \staticlang$, $a\in Ag$, $I=\{\psi_1,...,\psi_m\} \hookrightarrow \psi_c$, then
          the model update is given by:
          \begin{gather}
              M^a_I(w) := M|\psi_c
          \end{gather}
\end{itemize}
Similar to the definition of the precondition to the \textit{agent question operator}, we also require the agent to be knowledgeable about both the premise, and that the conclusion follows from these. We describe this by:
\begin{gather}
    \nonumber pre_{a}(I) := \\ \bigwedge\limits_{i\in1,m}K_a\psi_i \land K_a\Biggl(\Biggl(\:\bigwedge\limits_{i\in 1,m}\psi_i\Biggr) \hookrightarrow \psi_c \Biggr)
\end{gather}
We now have the prerequisites for defining the semantics of our dynamic language \dynlang. They are based on the previous listed in \crefrange{sem:1}{sem:5} describing the \staticlang, extending it with the newly introduced \textit{information update operator}, \textit{agent question operator} and \textit{inference operator}:
\begin{gather}
    M, w \models [\psi!]\varphi \iff \\
    \nonumber M, w \models \psi \implies M|\psi, w \models \varphi \\\nonumber \\
    M, w \models [Q_A?]_{a,b}\varphi \iff \\
    \nonumber M, w \models pre_{a,b}(Q_A) \implies M^{a,b}_{Q_A?}(w), w \models \varphi\\\nonumber\\
    M, w \models [I]_a\varphi \iff \\
    \nonumber M, w \models pre_a(I) \implies M^a_I(w), w \models \varphi
\end{gather}
Informally, these simply explain that the semantics for the update of worlds only hold if their preconditions hold, which then in turn implies that the worlds accessible after the model update includes the conclusive proposition. \\

We have now formally described the definitive language of \dynlang, which lays
the foundation for our implementation of simulating our modelled social
deduction game.
