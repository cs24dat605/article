One can ponder that these results may be because of the 
limited team size of
the game, as the blackmailer and consort roles may 
thrive when being able to
use
their actions on powerful town roles, but without 
enough investigative and
murderous power behind them, they are unable to find 
the right targets, nor
finish the job if they do find them. Our results however do yield us 
an insight into the effects of each role, and with a different approach to implementation, 
experimentation could definitely be feasible computation wise. Our results also shows us, 
just how unpredictable these type of games are, and regardless of what composition we choose,
both sides still have a realistic probability of winning, in many cases even equal.
