From our experiments, we can clearly see, that the ability to eliminate players
during the night, and to be able to continue doing so for as long as possible,
is the most important ability for the mafia. One can ponder if these results
may be influenced by the limited size of the teams used in the games, as the
blackmailer and consort roles may thrive when being able to use their actions
on powerful town roles. But with a mafia team of size 3 these roles may lack
enough investigative and murderous power, resulting in them being either unable
to find the right targets, or finish the job if they do find them.\\ Our
results have provided useful insights into the impactfulness of each mafia
role, and with a different approach to the implementation, one might be able to
construct larger game sizes, without the heavy computational burden of the
chosen approach. Our results also shows us, just how unpredictable these type
of games are, and regardless of what composition we choose, both sides still
have a realistic probability of winning, in many cases, even close to equal
chances.
