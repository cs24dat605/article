\section{Future Works}\label{sec:future-works}
Should research into this area be continued, one might suggest beginning by
performing alterations in the following areas:
\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep0px 
	\item More roles such as: framer, janitor, bodyguard, lookout, etc.
	\item More factions such as: neutral roles, werewolves, witches, vampires, etc.
	\item Re-factorization of the code into building knowledge from zero, instead of
	      pruning knowledge from all possibilities. This would result in improved run
	      times and smaller memory usage.
	\item Possible representation of knowledge in the code as Binary Decision Diagrams or
	      Logical formulae. This would further improve run times and memory usage.
	\item Clearer choices between accuse and inquire communicative actions, as the game
	      currently chooses these actions randomly despite their potentially inequivalent
	      outcomes.
	\item Clearer voting strategies for whom the town should target first, as their
	      highest priority, as currently they vote randomly within mafia members.
	\item Add method for Consigliere to share their gained information with the mafia.
	\item Fine-tune information gained by investigator.
\end{enumerate}
