\section{Future Works}\label{sec:future-works}
Should research into this area be continue, one might suggest to begin 
performing alterations in the following areas:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item More roles such as: framer, janitor, bodyguard, lookout, etc.
	\item More factions such as: neutral roles, werewolves, witches, vampires, 
	etc.
	\item Re-factorization of the code into building knowledge from zero, 
	instead of pruning knowledge from all possibilities. This would result in 
	improved run times and smaller memory usage. 
	\item Possible representation of knowledge in the code as Binary Decision 
	Diagrams or Logical formulae. This would further improve run times and 
	memory usage. 
\end{enumerate}
