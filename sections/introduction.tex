\section{Introduction}
Social deductions games have become increasingly popular, with many new 
variants being released in recent years. These games are typically fun to play, 
with different roles, actions and intense discussions adding complexity to an 
otherwise simple game premise. 

These games, be they video games or board games, pit players against each other 
through lies and deceit, tempting players into manipulating others with the 
intent to further their own goals. In general, these games have two factions, 
or teams, with players being given roles that may belong to either team. These 
roles may be simple, having no additional ‘special’ actions, or they may be 
able to impact the course of the game, and the gathering of information, in 
unique ways. Furthermore, these games typically have different, competing, win 
conditions for each faction, which are known to all players. One such game is 
the online video game ‘Town of Salem’. It is a social deduction game based on 
the game ‘Werewolf’, which itself is inspired by the original version of the 
game ‘Mafia’. These three games share the similarities, that there are 
typically two unequally sized teams, the town, being the larger, and the 
werewolves/mafia, being the smaller. The smaller team will henceforth be 
referred to as the Mafia. The games also share that they consist of four 
phases, the night phase where special actions take place, the morning phase 
where the public results of the night phase are revealed, the day phase where 
people discuss based on their acquired information, and the voting phase where 
everyone on both teams vote on who to lynch during this day phase. Then, the 
game repeats with a new night phase. 
The base game has two factions; the town and the mafia. The town wins by 
collectively lynching all of the mafia members, and the mafia wins by achieving 
a numerical player majority within the game. The roles most often used in these 
games include: An uninformed, town-allied majority with no special powers. The 
mafia, which will slowly eliminate the majority during the multiple night 
phases, and attempt to secretly spread misinformation throughout the town. 
Investigative roles, allied to the town, which have different methods for 
acquiring facts, such as privately viewing another player’s team during the 
night phase. 
However, one thing that is often overlooked in these games, is the simple fact, 
that in a game with multiple roles, getting one with no special actions, can 
feel boring, making the assigned player feel disinterested in the game. One 
method used to remedy this, is to add additional roles to the town team, since 
this team mostly consists of uninformed players with no special abilities. A 
side-effect of this is that the win rate of the town increases, as the addition 
of these roles necessarily result in more information being acquired by the 
town team. What we would like to investigate in this paper is the which roles 
could be added to the mafia team in order to equalize this growing unfair win 
rate. We would like to see which mafia roles have the highest impact on win 
rate, based on the number of initial players, the ratio of teams, different 
play-styles, and the starting composition of the town team. 
This will be analyzed by utilizing a self-developed, console-based simulation 
of the game, utilizing a probabilistic approach to decision making, with a 
foundation in epistemic logic. The game will be modeled with different role 
actions, voting strategies, communicative actions, and levels of selflessness.
