\section{Introduction}
When trying to solve a problem, many solutions may present themselves. However,
most of these will come with unintended side effects. In the world of social
deduction games, one specific problem that has presented itself is the fact
that as more diverse roles has been introduced, in order to keep the games
fresh, new, and exciting, an imbalance has presented itself in the win-rate
between the two teams. \\ \\ Most social deduction games have the same
foundation: Two teams, one larger with uninformed players, and one smaller with
informed players. Both teams want to eliminate the other team, with differing
methods of accomplishing this. Often times, the uninformed team have will have
a small number of special roles assigned to it, in order to be able to acquire
information, to be able to root out the smaller team. The smaller team
typically tries to stay hidden, while eliminating the players in the bigger
team.\\ \\ Historically, the larger team has typically been weighed down with
many players being assigned low-impact roles. As games have evolved, players
have grown bored of this dynamic and has led to the introduction of more roles,
in order to excite the players who were previously assigned the low-impact
roles. But as their roles are no longer low-impact, this has skewed the
win-rate of their team in their favor. This is problematic from a balance
perspective, and therefore this paper will look at how one can analyse and
introduce roles to the opposing team, in order to equalize this imbalance. The
roles that will be analysed consist mainly of two types: Information Gatherers
and Information Deniers. Through this analysis it will be able to draw general
conclusions on the topic of whether it is more important to gather information
for your own benefit, or to deny information to opposing entities. \\

This will be analysed by utilizing a self-developed, console-based simulation
of the game, utilizing a probabilistic approach to decision making, with a
foundation in epistemic logic. The game will be modelled with a variety of
roles and actions, as well as voting strategies and communicative options.

A sizable amount of research has been put into the field of social deduction
games. However, much of that research has been focused on strategies relating
to when and how to utilize different communicative actions\cite{commitment}.
Others focus on ways for the town to detect the mafia
members\cite{werewolf_stealth}, or protect key town members from the
mafia\cite{werewolf_nash_equilibrium}, and others still focus on the different
decision making strategies that can be implemented in multi agent systems,
which these games can be modelled
as\cite{modelling_multi_agent_epistemic_systems}\cite{multi_agent_epistemic_planner_common_knowledge}\cite{probibalistic_multiagent_systems}.

However, one thing that is noticeably absent from this research is analyses
with the focus of mitigating the previously mentioned side-effect, that arises
when playing against a team consisting of mostly high-impact roles.
Additionally, there is minimal research on the impact of the ability to inquire
other players, regarding their knowledge of the world. The outcome of such an
analysis might be a game setup where everyone involved can have a role with
special abilities. This may also mean that players will be more engaged and
active throughout all stages of the game. Lastly, it may also grant some
insight into whether it is more beneficial to gather information for oneself,
or to deny information to others.
