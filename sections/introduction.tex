\section{Introduction}
When trying to solve a problem, many solutions may present themselves. However,
most of these will come with unintended side effects. In the world of social
deduction games, one specific problem has manifested itself. As more diverse
roles have been introduced, in order to keep the games fresh, new, and
exciting, an imbalance has presented itself in the win-rate between the
opposing teams. \\ \\ Most social deduction games have the same foundation: The
players are divided into two teams, one larger with uninformed players, and one
smaller with informed players. Each of the teams wants to eliminate the other,
with differing methods of accomplishing this. Often, the uninformed team will
have a few special roles assigned to it, in order to acquire information, to be
able to root out the smaller team. The smaller team typically tries to stay
hidden, while eliminating the players in the bigger team.\\ \\ Historically,
the larger team has typically been burdened by the assignment of many
low-impact roles to its players. As games have evolved, players have grown
bored with this dynamic. That has led to the introduction of more roles, in
order to excite the players who were previously assigned the low-impact roles.
But as their roles are no longer low-impact, this has skewed the win-rate of
their team in their favour. This is problematic from a balance perspective, and
therefore this paper will look at how one can analyse and introduce roles to
the opposing team, in order to equalize this imbalance. The roles that will be
analysed consist mainly of two types: information- gatherers and deniers.
Through this analysis we will be able to draw a general conclusion on the topic
of whether it is more important to gather information for your own benefit, or
to deny information to opposing entities.

This will be analysed by utilizing a self-developed, console-based simulation
of a social deduction game, incorporating a numeric approach to
decision-making, with a foundation in epistemic logic. The game will be
modelled with a variety of roles and actions, as well as voting strategies and
communicative actions.

A sizeable amount of research has been put into the field of social deduction
games. However, much of that research has been focused on strategies relating
to when and how to utilize different communicative actions\cite{commitment}.
Some focus on ways for the town to detect the mafia
members\cite{werewolf_stealth}, or protect key town members from the
mafia\cite{werewolf_nash_equilibrium}. Others focus on the different
decision-making strategies that can be implemented in multiagent systems, which
these games can be modelled
as\cite{modelling_multi_agent_epistemic_systems}\cite{multi_agent_epistemic_planner_common_knowledge}\cite{probibalistic_multiagent_systems}.

However, one thing that is noticeably absent from this research is analyses
with the focus of mitigating the previously mentioned side effect, that arises
when playing against a team consisting of mostly high-impact roles.
Additionally, there is minimal research on the ability to inquire other
players, regarding their knowledge of the world. The outcome of such an
analysis might be a game setup where everyone involved can have a role with
special abilities. This may also mean that players will be more engaged and
active throughout all stages of the game. Lastly, it may also grant some
insight into whether it is more beneficial to gather information for oneself,
or to deny information to others.\\ \\

In the following section \ref{sec:RelatedWorks}, we will review papers and
studies that have significantly contributed to our area of study.

We then describe, how we intend to model our social deduction game in section
\ref{sec:Modelling}. It outlines the rules of the game and its operational
mechanics. Key roles will be explained in detail, as well as how agents
communicate with each other.

Continuing on to section \ref{sec:DynamicInquiryLanguage}, this section begins
with an introduction to the terminology and the inquiry language. We then
expand this to a static inquiry language with agents and knowledge. Finally, we
conclude the section by expanding it to a dynamic inquiry language with model
updates.

For the implementation section \ref{sec:implementation}, we provide a detailed
walkthrough a few of the processes utilized in our implementation. We start by
introducing the various data structures and then explain how each 'phase' of
the game is computed.

In the final sections of the paper \ref{sec:results}, \ref{sec:discussion}, and
\ref{sec:conclusion}, we present all our findings from our experiments.
