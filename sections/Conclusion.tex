\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
It seems that the question posed at the beginning of this paper in
\cref{sec:introduction}: "\textit{whether it is more important to gather
    information for your own benefit, or to deny information to opposing
    entities?}" has been answered. In this specific approach and implementation, it
is definitively more beneficial to gather information for oneself, though the
most important aspect is the capability to be able to execute, both
figuratively and literally, on this information, in order to remove powerful
opponents from play.
