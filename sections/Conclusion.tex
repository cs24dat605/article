Furthermore, it seems that the question posed at the 
beginning of this paper: "\textit{Is it more beneficial

definitively more beneficial to gather information for 
oneself, though the most important aspect is the 
capability to be able to execute, both figuratively and 
literally, on this information, in order to remove 
powerful opponents from play.
