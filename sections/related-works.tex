In a paper [1], Eger and Martens analyzed the effect of commitment to a plan in
the game One Night Ultimate Werewolf. They modeled this using Dynamic Epistemic
Logic, allowing each agent to be aware of multiple different possible worlds
with alternating sets of facts, and sorting them based on the least likelihood
of it being true. This is achieved by ‘marking’ worlds with statements made by
other agents if these worlds contained lies made by the other agents. When an
agent needs to choose what to base their next action on, they determine based
on the number of marks of other players, or simply nothing. They proclaim this
gives the agents a certain degree of planning. \\ However, due to the increasing
amount of worlds generated by new actions performed, many of them equivalent, a
notion of commitment is introduced, in which they will stick with a certain
plan until another plan is valued significantly higher. They compare this
commitment to a baseline of random actions by villagers, resulting in a high
win percentage for werewolves, proving their hypothesis. In a game of both
werewolves and villagers with weighted worlds, they found that simply valuing
the plans equally, that is choose the new plan if it is at least as good as the
previous, resulted in the lowest win percentage for werewolves. \\ The
Interrogative Model of Inquiry (IMI) and Dynamic Epistemic Logics (DEL) are
both central paradigms of formal epistemology, but where one lacks, the other
excels. While IMI provides knowledge reasoning and inference in a multi-turn
information-gathering process between an Inquirer and Nature, DEL models how
each agent updates their knowledge in a multi-agent setting. In 2014
Y.Hamami[2] published a formalization of how to combine these, which combines
the information-gathering process in an inquiry with respect to multi-agent
dimensions. As opposed to standard IMI or DEL, the proposed DELIMI sees
information as acquired by either common knowledge or from other agents in an
interrogation. The inclusion of agents also introduces the notion of lying,
that is answering an interrogative question with non-factual information,
closely representing the nature of social deduction games. In reality, both the
intrigue and the complexity of social deduction games often arise from the
discussions involved between players, which we see as a core part of this type
of game. While other works related to social deduction games have resorted
mostly to rely on simple one-way actions, the DELIMI model allows agents to
interrogate others, perhaps challenge their claims, find inconsistencies, or
use logical inference to establish presuppositions.

!!Language, Truth and Logic in Mathematics!! and Kripke in establishing the
principles for reasoning about knowledge and belief. Specifically, we utilize
independence-friendly first-order logic. Additionally, we adopt the semantic
framework proposed by Baltag, Moss, and Solecki (2004) !!Logics for Epistemic
Actions: Completeness, Decidability, Expressivity!! to model the dynamic
aspects of knowledge and belief within different environments.
