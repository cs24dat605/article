  abstract  = {The Interrogative Model of Inquiry (IMI) and Dynamic Epistemic Logics (DELs) are two central paradigms in formal epistemology. This paper is motivated by the observation of a significant complementarity between them: on the one hand, the IMI provides a framework for investigating inquiry represented as an idealized game between an Inquirer and Nature, along with an account of the interaction between questions and inferences in information-seeking processes, but is lacking a formulation in the multi-agent case; on the other hand, DELs model various operations of information change in multi-agent systems, but the field is lacking a proper integration of question and inference dynamics, along with an application to the investigation of inquiry processes. The goal of this paper is to integrate the two paradigms in such a way as to combine their respective insights. To this end, we develop a formal system called DELIMI which aims to represent the interaction between question and inference dynamics in inquiry—as described by the IMI—in a multi-agent setting, and this in such a way as to enable an investigation of inquiry games with multi-agent dimensions. The DELIMI system is designed to represent the possible moves of such inquiry games through three types of epistemic actions: agents addressing questions to Nature, agents addressing questions to other agents, agents drawing logical inferences. We then show how the resulting framework can be used to formally define multi-agent inquiry games. We conclude by evaluating the interest of the DELIMI system for the IMI and DELs paradigms.},

	abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; Social deduction games present a unique challenge for AI agents, because communication plays a central role in most of them, and deception plays a key role in game play. To be successful in such games, players need to come up with convincing stories, but also discern the truth of statements of other players and adapt to the information learned from them. In this paper we present an approach for virtual agents that have to determine how long to stick to their story in the light of information obtained from other players. We apply this approach to a particular social deduction game, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and demonstrate the effect of different levels of commitment to an agent’s story. &lt;/p&gt; },

	abstract={Over the past decade Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have emerged as a successful approach to develop distributed applications. In recent years proposals have been made to extend MAS models with probabilistic behavior. Languages to reason about such systems were presented in order to deal with uncertainty that can be encountered in practical application domains. While in recent works model checking techniques have been successfully applied for verifying knowledge in classical MAS, no methods for verifying knowledge in probabilistic MAS yet exist. This paper proposes such a model checking approach for probabilistic MAS. The approach comprises a compositional modeling process, a modal logic with operators for the specification of epistemic and temporal properties, the corresponding model checking procedure, and an outline of how these techniques can be implemented into existing model checking tools. The advantages of the chosen design include the possibility to analyze the MAS both from the global perspective as well as from the perspective of the agents, and the polynomial complexity of the model checking algorithm.},
